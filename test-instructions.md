# Testing Instructions

## Fixed Issues

### 1. WPM Calculation Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: WPM was showing 0 during and after typing tests
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the character counting logic to properly include spaces
  - Updated the calculation to use correct characters divided by 5 (standard word length)
  - Fixed the timing calculation to use minutes instead of seconds
  - Added proper space counting between words

### 2. Leaderboards Updated ✅
- **Problem**: Leaderboards only showed demo/fake data
- **Solution**:
  - Now includes actual user test results
  - Combines user's best scores with demo data for demonstration
  - Filters results by test mode and language
  - Shows user's username when logged in

## How to Test

### Testing WPM Calculation:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Start typing any words
3. You should now see live WPM updating in real-time
4. Complete a test to see final WPM results
5. The results page should show accurate WPM, Raw WPM, and accuracy

### Testing Leaderboards:
1. Complete a few typing tests with different scores
2. Go to the Leaderboards page
3. You should see your results mixed with demo data
4. Try different test modes (15s, 30s, etc.) to see filtered results
5. If logged in, your username should appear in the leaderboards

### Quick Test Scenario:
1. **Start a 15-second test**
2. **Type at a steady pace** - you should see live WPM updating
3. **Complete the test** - check that WPM is calculated correctly
4. **Go to Leaderboards** - verify your result appears there
5. **Try different test modes** to see various WPM calculations

## Expected Behavior

- **Live Stats**: Should show updating WPM, accuracy, and raw WPM during typing
- **Results Page**: Should display accurate final statistics
- **Leaderboards**: Should include your test results alongside demo data
- **User Integration**: If logged in, your username should appear in results and leaderboards

The application should now properly calculate and display typing speed metrics!
